This is a [Kobweb](https://github.com/varabyte/kobweb) project which is also a talk about Kobweb itself.

If you'd like to run it yourself locally, after installing Kobweb and syncing the code, type the following commands:

```bash
$ cd site
$ kobweb run
```

These slides are also hosted at https://bitspittle.github.io/kotlinconf25/

While some slides are extremely simple and totally static, many have multiple steps.

Press SPACE to move forward to the next step or SHIFT+SPACE to take one step back. You can also use LEFT and RIGHT to
jump to the end of the previous slide or the beginning of the next.
